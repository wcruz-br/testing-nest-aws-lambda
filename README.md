# AWS Lambda with NestJS

## Building for AWS Lambda Function

```bash
npm run build:lambda
```

## Creating zip for upload

```bash
./zipa.sh
```

Upload this zip to your lambda function and call its URL - alas!

(This example was adapted from [this old repository](https://github.com/gemerick/nest-lambda). There is a lot of things here we don't need here, I was in a hurry and just trying to prove that it works. If you clean things here, send a PR, thank you!)
